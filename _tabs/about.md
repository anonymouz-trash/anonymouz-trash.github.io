This is ment to be a documentation site were I write everything down of whatever case or problem I ran into.
I hope it will help you as well.

Little things for you to know:
* I use debian-like-systems for my servers
* I use Arch Linux for nearly all my clients
* I will keep the Docs as short and efficient as possible
