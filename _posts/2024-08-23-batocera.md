Batocera.linux is an open-source and completely free retro-gaming distribution that can be copied to a USB stick or an SD card with the aim of turning any computer/nano computer into a gaming console during a game or permanently. Batocera.linux does not require any modification on your computer.

## Installation besides other linux installs
First of all you have to create two partitions on the drive you want to use. 

| order | label | type | size | decscription |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | BATOCERA | FAT32 | 10 GiB | Main OS partition. It has to be EFI and bootable. |
| 2 | SHARE | ext4 / btrfs | 10 GiB | "Games" partition. |

> NTFS for the "SHARE"-partition is possible but **not** recommended. I understand if you're using a dual-boot setup like Windows and Batocera and want to share this partition with both operating systems, but you will get massive file permission problems because Batocera.linux is creating WINE prefixes for some emulators and they have to be on linux partitions.
{: .prompt-info }
> Important: BATOCERA will **always** watch at the next partition and assume it to be the `SHARE` partition regardingless of what you actually named it.
{: .prompt-danger}

Go to [https://mirrors.o2switch.fr/batocera/x86_64/stable/last/](https://mirrors.o2switch.fr/batocera/x86_64/stable/last/) and download the latest `boot.tar.xz`.

Afterwards extract the contents of `boot.tar.xz` to your `BATOCERA` partition. Note that the `EFI` directory (and all other contents) must be in the root folder of the drive. I recommend using `p7zip` on Linux or [`7-Zip`](https://www.7-zip.org/) on Windows for that.

#### Dual-boot Batocera.linux
I assume that you have the `GRUB` bootloader installed and running.
Now create a file named `15_batocera` in `/etc/grub.d/` with the following content.
```bash
#! /bin/sh

BATOCERA_UUID=$(lsblk --fs --noheadings --pairs -o TYPE,LABEL,UUID |
		       grep -E '^TYPE="part" LABEL="BATOCERA" UUID="[^"]*"$' |
		       sed -e s+'^TYPE="part" LABEL="BATOCERA" UUID="\([^"]*\)"$'+'\1'+ | head -1)

if test -n "${BATOCERA_UUID}"
then
    echo "Image batocera found on ${BATOCERA_UUID}" >&2

    cat <<EOF
menuentry "batocera.linux" {
      search --set=root --label BATOCERA
      linux /boot/linux label=BATOCERA console=tty3 quiet loglevel=0 vt.global_cursor_default=0
      initrd /boot/initrd.gz
}
EOF
fi
```
{: file="/etc/grub.d/15_batocera"}

Afterwards adjust the file permissons.
```bash
chmod 0755 /etc/grub.d/15_batocera
```

For `GRUB` to be able to detect other operating systems you need to have `os-prober` to be installed.
```bash
sudo pacman -S os-prober
```

Edit `/etc/grub/default` and look for a variable that is called `GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false` and uncomment it.
```bash
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```
{: file="/etc/grub/default"}

When finished update `GRUB`.
```bash
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
> As you can see in the previously created script looks for the UUID and the partition type part (FAT32) with the label BATOCERA and automatically adds it as menu entry to GRUB itself.
{: .prompt-info }

## Use external drives with just bioses, roms and saves on it
> The benefit of configuring Batocera that way is that you don't have make space for all your games on every device were Batocera runs on and you can also bring your save states with you. I for myself have a desktop computer, a laptop and a Raspberry Pi to play on. I don't have to worry of each Batocera system-specific configuration. I just connect the external hard drive and that's it.
{: .prompt-info }

Get the UUID of your external drive running `blkid` as **root**.
```bash
sudo blkid
```
Output:
```terminal
/dev/zram0: LABEL="zram0" UUID="3e348884-074d-457d-af7d-bbb2c033bfde" TYPE="swap"
/dev/sdb2: LABEL="SHARE" UUID="5c329796-f5ae-487d-b747-3255c7b1b0a5" BLOCK_SIZE="4096" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="d33ee098-291d-400c-b126-da21290a6039"
/dev/sdb1: LABEL_FATBOOT="BATOCERA" LABEL="BATOCERA" UUID="2067-EAA3" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat" PARTUUID="11dc25ef-a08a-4735-962b-dfe94a645adf"
/dev/sda2: UUID="232c16da-6f07-4f54-9bc1-494f97c05c5e" BLOCK_SIZE="4096" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="aa4bab10-ebb0-4af7-a13e-7b28e7dc4a2f"
/dev/sda1: UUID="219E-A7C7" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat" PARTUUID="c9519e0e-d630-4fa3-968e-785b57c0d4bd"
```
> For me, let's assume, it would be /dev/sdb2. Then the UUID would be `5c329796-f5ae-487d-b747-3255c7b1b0a5`. **Don't** get confused with the PARTUUID.
{: .prompt-info }

Edit `batocera-boot.conf` on your BATOCERA partition. Look for a line that begins with `shardevice=INTERNAL` and replace it with the below code.
```bash
sharedevice=DEVICES
sharedevice_part1=ROMS@b51a2311-5f13-49e8-b930-d17b4d705fa7:/batocera/roms
sharedevice_part2=SAVES@b51a2311-5f13-49e8-b930-d17b4d705fa7:/batocera/saves
sharedevice_part3=BIOS@b51a2311-5f13-49e8-b930-d17b4d705fa7:/batocera/bios
```
{: file="batocera-boot.conf"}

| value | description |
| --- | --- |
| sharedevice=DEVICES | Stands for external *DEVICES*. This could be several things even remote locations. |
| sharedevice_part*X* | Specifies to storage location of folders to be replaced with. |

## Adding Nintendo Switch emulation (by [foclabroc](https://github.com/foclabroc/batocera-switch))

### Installation
In Batocera hit `F1` in the main menu and start a terminal you'll find it in `Applications > xterm `.

```bash
curl -L bit.ly/foclabroc-switchoff-40 | bash
```
> This command is for Batocera version <=40
{: .prompt-info }
```bash
curl -L bit.ly/foclabroc-switchoff | bash
```
> This command is for Batocera version >=41
{: .prompt-info }

## Install additional emulators / software with uureels' batocera.pro (Deprecated)
![batocera.pro-apps](https://github.com/uureel/batocera.pro/raw/main/app/pro.PNG)

### Installation
In Batocera hit `F1` in the main menu and start a terminal you'll find it in `Applications > xterm `.
```bash
curl -L app.batocera.pro | bash
```
Check out his [GitHub](https://github.com/uureel/batocera.pro) for all possible installation URLs.

#### App removal
Sadly you have to remove the corresponding app folder by your own. There are in following directories:
* /userdata/roms/ports (maybe)
* /userdata/system/pro Applications in `F1 > Applications` will disappear after reboot.
