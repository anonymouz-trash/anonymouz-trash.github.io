Recently I discovered and learned how to configure Time-based One-Time-Password for local and remote terminal authentications. This is awesome and very useful for sensitive devices.

## Installation
```shell
apt install libpam-google-authenticator
```

## Compatibility
To list all services compatible with Google Authenticator, run the following command:
```shell
ls -m /etc/pam.d/
```

Output:
```console
user@server:~# ls -m /etc/pam.d/
chfn, chpasswd, chsh, common-account, common-auth, common-password, common-session, common-session-noninteractive, cron, login, newusers, other, passwd, runuser, runuser-l, samba, su, su-l, sudo
```

## Configuration
Run Google Authenticator:
```shell
google-authenticator
```

Output:
```console
user@server:~# google-authenticator

Do you want authentication tokens to be time-based (y/n)

```
> Answer y, to create TOTP tokens (time-based one-time passwords) or n, to create HOTP tokens (counter-based one-time passwords). Choose y.
{: .prompt-info }

Output:
```console
Warning: pasting the following URL into your browser exposes the OTP secret to Google:
  https://www.google.com/chart?chs=200x200&chld=M|0&cht=qr&chl=otpauth://totp/user@server%3Fsecret%3DRIDTERNTUFGXBEWAA6XZSPGGOQ%26issuer%3Dserver

< Displayed QR-Code >

Your new secret key is: RIDTERNTUFGXBEWAA6XZSPGGOQ
Enter code from app (-1 to skip):
```
> Enter your confirmation code from your Authenticator-App and press Enter to continue.
{: .prompt-info }

Output:
```console
Your emergency scratch codes are:
  73947498
  36703725
  55642172
  78525989
  12348980

Do you want me to update your "/user/.google_authenticator" file? (y/n)
```
> Securly store the given scratch codes! You can use them to access your device even when you lost access to your Authenticator-App.

## Enable TOTP for SSH logins
> Important: If you perform the following configuration via an SSH session, be sure to maintain the existing session and test it with a second session in parallel. If the SSH daemon is misconfigured, you will no longer be able to log in.
{: .prompt-warning }

### Edit /etc/pam.d/sshd
Uncomment the @include common-auth line and add the Google Authenticator line below. Then save and close the file.

```bash
# Standard Un*x authentication.
#@include common-auth

# Google Authenticator
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so

```
{: file="/etc/pam.d/sshd"}

### Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
In this configuration file you can now set `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` to yes. Also check whether UsePAM is set to yes and add the AuthenticationMethods line below it. In this example, authentication via public key and one-time password is accepted.

```bash
# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with
# some PAM modules and threads)
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

UsePAM yes
AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive

```
{: file="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"}

## Restart SSH-Service

```shell
systemctl restart sshd.service
```

## Troubleshooting

```shell
journalctl -n 100 -u sshd.service
```
