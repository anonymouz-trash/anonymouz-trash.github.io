## Definition
To make this clear. I've seen many very beauftiful Hyprland configurations around the internet, but keep in mind, installing and configuring Hyprland isn't easy and you have to tinker around with it. Additionally it's possible that any updates could break your configuration.

With that in mind let's get started! ;o)

## Installation
You have the option to manually install Hyprland...
```bash
sudo pacman -S hyprland
```
> If you want to all additional Hyprland packages as well then install ```hyprland-meta```.
{: .prompt-info }

... or you choose it from a fresh install with **`archinstall`**.
Therefor choose **`Hyprland`** under Profile > Desktop

After rebooting login in your terminal session and move on with your desired preconfigured setup.

## Out-Of-Box-Experience with scripts and dotfiles
As I wrote you have different options here. These are the 4 most popular ones I found.
