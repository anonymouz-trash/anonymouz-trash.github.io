Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others. 

## Installation
```bash
apt install samba smbclient
```

## Configuration
Before you edit `/etc/smb.conf` I'd recommend to make a copy of the original.
```bash
cp -v /etc/samba/smb.conf{,.orig}
```

```bash
[global]
        workgroup = WORKGROUP
        server role = standalone server
        passdb backend = tdbsam
        usershare allow guests = Yes
[share]
        comment = share dir
        path = /path/to/share
        read only = No
        store dos attributes = Yes
        inherit acls = Yes
[homes]
        comment = Home Directories
        valid users = %S
        browseable = No
        read only = No
        inherit acls = Yes
        create mode = 0600
        directory mode = 0700
[admin]
        path = /path/to/admin/share
        comment = admin share
        valid users = root @sudo @wheel
        browseable = No
        read only = No
        inherit acls = Yes
        create mode = 0600
        directory mode = 0700
[nobody]
	browsable = no

```
{: file="/etc/smb.conf"}

Highly recommended:
```bash
man smb.conf
```

{: .prompt-info }

You have to set user passwords twice per added user to SMB server and the *user* has to be in **sambashare** groups.
```bash
useradd -m user -s /bin/bash -g sambashare
passwd user
smbpassword -a user
```

## Usage
```bash
systemctl enable smbd.service
```
```bash
systemctl ( start | stop | restart | status ) smbd.service
```
Testing if your shares are available.
```bash
smbclient -N -L localhost
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| -N | Means without authentication, remove it if authentication is needed. |
| -L | List all available shares. |
| localhost | It's better to insert the IP of the SMB server here. |

## Connect to a share
```bash
smbclient -U username%password //target/share
```

## Troubleshooting
```bash
journalctl -u smbd.service -f -n20
```

```bash
systemctl ( start | stop | restart | status ) smbd.service
```
