## Definition
Plymouth is a project from Fedora and now listed among the freedesktop.org's official resources providing a flicker-free graphical boot process.

## Installation
```bash
sudo pacman -S plymouth
```
`KDE` users can also download new plymouth themes via settings, therefor you have to download:
```bash
sudo pacman -S plymouth-kcm
```

## Configuration
Edit `/etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf`.
```bash
[Daemon]
Theme=spinner
ShowDelay=0
```
{: file="/etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf"}

| option | description |
| --- | --- |
| Theme= | specify the theme you want to use according to folder name in `/usr/share/plymouth/themes`|
| ShowDelay | 0 = disabled, delay of time in seconds, if your computer boots to fast that you can't see plymouth |

Edit `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`.
```bash
HOOKS=(... base udev plymouth autodetect microcode ...)
```
{: file="/etc/mkinitcpio.conf"
}
> The plymouth hook has to be placed between **udev** and **autodetect**
{: .prompt-tip}

After this re-create initramfs by:
```bash
sudo mkinitcpio -p
```

Edit `/etc/default/grub` or your desired bootloader.
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet splash"
```
[: file="/etc/default/grub"]

> The kernel parameter `splash` must be set to load plymouth
{: .prompt-info }

## Smooth transitions
If you want smooth transitions you can place an `dropin-snippet` to `display-manager.service`.
```bash
sudo systemctl edit display-manager.service --drop-in=plymouth
```
Next there opens your default editor where you have to just drop-in the following code and save/close it.
```bash
[Unit]
Conflicts=plymouth-quit.service
After=plymouth-quit.service rc-local.service plymouth-start.service systemd-user-sessions.service
OnFailure=plymouth-quit.service

[Service]
ExecStartPost=-/usr/bin/sleep 30
ExecStartPost=-/usr/bin/plymouth quit --retain-splash
```
It should create successfully a new conf file for your display-manager.service like `/etc/systemd/system/sddm.service.d/plymouth.conf`.

> This is not needed for GNOME or KDE.
{: .prompt-info }

## Usage
For a list of installed themes to can have a look into `/usr/share/plymouth/themes` or type:
```bash
plymouth-set-default-theme -l
```
From the command-line you can use this to change the theme and re-create initramfs at once.
```bash
plymouth-set-default-theme -R theme
```
Themes can be previewed without rebuilding initrd, press `Ctrl+Alt+F6` to switch to a text terminal, log in as root and type:
```bash
plymouthd
plymouth --show-splash
```
To quit the preview, press Ctrl+Alt+F6 again and type:
```bash
plymouth --quit
```
> You can run these commands as root in a running X.Org session too, but the Plymouth window may cover your terminal window and lock itself on top. This doesn't work in Wayland sessions.
{: .prompt-info }

## Troubleshooting
If you experience any problems during boot, you can temporarliy disable Plymouth by kernel parameters.

In `GRUB` for example when bootloader shows up hit `e` on Arch Linux boot entry. Edit the line which starts with `linux /vmlinuz`.
```bash
linux   /vmlinuz-linux root=UUID=[...] rw zswap.enabled=0 rootfstype=ext4 plymouth.enable=0 disablehooks=plymouth
```
When edited start the boot process with `F10`. Your system should boot normaly and you can make changes.
