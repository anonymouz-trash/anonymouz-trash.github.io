The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed name service that provides a naming system for computers, services, and other resources on the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Most prominently, it translates readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.

## Prerequisite
Disable "run at boot" and shutdown the following service.
```bash
systemctl disable --now systemd-reolved.service
```
> This seems deprecated since Debian 12 but it might important for other distros like RHEL.
{: .prompt-info }

Edit `/etc/resolv.conf` to always resolve dns queries from localhost (with bind9).
```bash
nameserver 127.0.0.1
```
{: file="/etc/resolv.conf"}

## Installation
```bash
apt install bind9
```

## Configuration
Following files in `/etc/bind/` are mandatory:

| file | description |
| --- | --- |
| named.conf | Main configuration file which combines all other configuration files |
| named.conf.local | Local zone configuration file |
| named.conf.options | Permissions configuration file, e.g. for the daemon |
| /var/cache/bind/"zonefile" | Lists entries of dns queries IP to domain |

Edit `/etc/bind/named.conf.options`, this is an example.
```bash
options {
        directory "/var/cache/bind";
        dnssec-validation no;
        allow-recursion { localhost; 192.168.0.0/24 };
};
```
{: file="/etc/bind/named.conf.options"}

| option | description |
| --- | --- |
| directory | Defines the directory in which the local zone files are stored |
| dnssec-validation | Defines the usage of DNSSEC if you configured it. |
| allow-recursion | Networks that are allowed to make DNS requestes. |

## Create forward lookup zone
Edit `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`.
```bash
zone "local.lan" {
        type master;
				file "local.lan";
};
```
{: file="/etc/bind/named.conf.local"}

Edit zone file in `/var/cache/bind/local.lan`, if it doesn't exist create it. The file name must be the same as in `zone block` under `file`.
```bash
$TTL 300
@       IN SOA  dns.local.lan. mail.local.lan. (2023041702 14400 3600 3600000 86400)
        IN NS   dns
dns     IN A    192.168.0.2
fw      IN A    192.168.0.1
```
{: file="/var/cache/bind/local.lan"}

> Important: Next to IN SOA dns domain, there must be a, maybe yet fictive, mail domain be configured!
{: .prompt-warning }

| value | description |
| --- | --- |
| 2023041702 | Date = 20230417 = YYYYMMDD; Version of DNS-Zone |
| 14400 | refresh time between primary and secondary dns servers |
| 3600 | retry time between primary and secondary dns servers |
| 3600000 | expire time |
| 86400 | negative cache, secondary dns servers are caching negative answers |

> All time related values are in sconds.
{: .prompt-info }

## Usage
```bash
systemctl enable bind9.service
systemctl enable named.service
```
```bash
systemctl ( start | stop | restart ) bind9.service
systemctl ( start | stop | restart ) named.service
```

## Create reverse lookup zone
Edit `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`.
```bash
zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        file "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa";
};
```
{: file="/etc/bind/named.conf.local"}

Edit zone file in `/var/cache/bind/0.168.192.in-addr.arpa`, if it doesn't exist create it. The file name must be the same as in `zone block` under `file`.
```bash
$TTL 300
@       IN SOA  dns.local.lan. mail.local.lan. (2023041702 14400 3600 3600000 86400)
        IN NS   dns.local.lan.
1       IN PTR  fw.local.lan.
2       IN PTR  dns.local.lan.
```
{: file="/var/cache/bind/0.168.192.in-addr.arpa"}

> Important: Next to IN SOA dns domain, there must be a, maybe yet fictive, mail domain be configured!
{: .prompt-warning }

| value | description |
| --- | --- |
| 2023041702 | Date = 20230417 = YYYYMMDD; Version of DNS-Zone |
| 14400 | refresh time between primary and secondary dns servers |
| 3600 | retry time between primary and secondary dns servers |
| 3600000 | expire time |
| 86400 | negative cache, secondary dns servers are caching negative answers |
> All time related values are in sconds.
{: .prompt-info }

## Troubleshooting
```bash
systemctl status bind9.service
```
```bash
systemctl status named.service
```

Type `journalctl -u` to show the last 30 entries with `-n30`.
```bash
journalctl -u named.service -f -n30
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| -u | Systemd unit, like `named.service` |
| -f | Following, new offers will displayed immediatly |
| -n*X* | Also display the last *X* entries |

To check the bind9 configuration syntax in `named.conf.*` files you can use:
```bash
named-checkconf
named-checkzone local.lan /var/cache/bind/local.lan
```
> *local.lan* is depending on your configured zone file name
{: .prompt-info }

Test DNS forward lookup with dig.
```bash
dig +short @10.12.0.2 fw.local.net
```

Test DNS reverse lookup with dig.
```bash
dig +short @10.12.0.2 -x 10.12.0.1
```

Lookup a complete zone if you have the right to.
```bash
dig axfr local.lan
```

| paramter | description |
| --- | --- |
| +short | Optione to only show IP or hostname. For more verbose output use +trace. |
| @10.12.0.2 | DNS-server to use |
| fw.local.net | Targeted hostname or IP if using -x |

## Dynamic DNS (DDNS)
DDNS services keep hostnames up to date with the latest dynamic IP address. This way, IP addresses can change as much as they like without causing any confusion or deeming requests for information unsuccessful.
> If DDNS didn't exist, DNS records would have to be updated manually every time a connection is made.
{: .prompt-tip }

### Preparation
For automatic DNS updates a SHA256-key is needed. Copy that key to clipboard because we will need it later.
```bash
echo -n "Very secret secret..." | openssl sha256 -hmac "nonbase64key" | awk '{print $2}'
```
> The text in `echo` you can choose randomly. The larger the text the better.
{: .prompt-info }

The Ouput should look something like this:
```terminal
a8796575ab0a3124fb753162ede33776284d38ae3c62a78e80420435d9238336
```

### Configuration
Edit `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`.
```bash
key ddns-update.key {
    algorithm HMAC-SHA256;
    secret "a8796575ab0a3124fb753162ede33776284d38ae3c62a78e80420435d9238336";
 };
 ```
 {: file="/etc/bind/named.conf.local"}
 > This code block must be placed above the zone declaration.
 {: .prompt-info }
 
 Edit your `forward zone definition` to `allow-update`(s) with the previously generated `key`.
 ```bash
 zone "local.lan" {
        type master;
        allow-update { key ddns-update.key; };
        file "local.lan";
};
```
{: file="/etc/bind/named.conf.local"}

Edit your `reverse zone definition` to `allow-update`(s) with the previously generated `key`.
```bash
zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        allow-update { key ddns-update.key; };
        file "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa";
};
```
{: file="/etc/bind/named.conf.local"}

Afterwards you have to restart `bind9`.
```bash
systemctl restart bind9
```

### Adding hosts entries per script
Now we create a little shell script. Sounds hard, but it will become handy later on. Let's call it `ddns_add_host.sh`.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
TTL=300
SERVER="10.12.0.2"
HOSTNAME=$1
IP=$2
KEY="a8796575ab0a3124fb753162ede33776284d38ae3c62a78e80420435d9238336"
KEYNAME="ddns-update.key"
HMAC=hmac-sha256:$KEYNAME:$KEY
date >> /var/log/ddns.log
nsupdate -y $HMAC  2>> /var/log/ddns.log << EOF
server $SERVER 
update add $HOSTNAME $TTL A $IP
send
EOF
```
{: file="ddns_add_host.sh"}

| variable | description |
| --- | --- |
| SERVER="" | Your primary DNS-server who should receive the updates. |
| HOSTNAME="" | Fully-Qualified-Domain-Name (FQDN) of your new host, e.g. mail.local.lan |
| IP="" | IP of your new host. |
> `$1` and `$2` are parameters given when the script is executed, like `./ddns_add_host.sh $1 $2`
{: .prompt-info }

Then the script must set to be executable...
```bash
chmod +x ddns_add_host.sh
```
... and executed like this:
```bash
./ddns_add_host.sh mail.local.lan 10.12.0.3
 ```

### Deleting hosts entries per script
Copy the little shell script we created earlier. Let's call it `ddns_del_host.sh`.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
TTL=300
SERVER="10.12.0.2"
HOSTNAME=$1
KEY="a8796575ab0a3124fb753162ede33776284d38ae3c62a78e80420435d9238336"
KEYNAME="ddns-update.key"
HMAC=hmac-sha256:$KEYNAME:$KEY
date >> /var/log/ddns.log
nsupdate -y $HMAC  2>> /var/log/ddns.log << EOF
server $SERVER 
update delete $HOSTNAME
send
EOF
```
{: file="ddns_del_host.sh"}

Execute it like:
```bash
./ddns_del_host.sh test.local.lan
```

### Troubleshooting and testing
As you might noticed the script writes a log file to `/var/log/ddns.log`. It contains just the date and update occurs, because nsupdate don't print  a success message, but you can look after error messages. That's what `2>>` in the script means and does. 
`bind9` also creates a new journal file for the new / updated host located at `/var/cache/bind/local.lan.jnl`. But the output looks weird because it's binary. The following is just an example log for presentation.
```bash
;BIND LOG V9.2
x*x*8x*x*x*Nnetz012lab,7dnsnetz012labinfonetz012labx*8@6QNnetz012lab,7dnsnetz012labinfonetz012labx*8@6Q!mortinetz012lab,
```
{: file="/var/cache/bind/local.lan.jnl"}
> When the DNS server gets restarted the journal file will be merged into your zone file. Changes may occur compared to your editing.
{: .prompt-info }

You can also prove your success with the known `dig` commands.

## Update DDNS with DHCP
In medium to large enterprise companies this can come in very handy for logging purposes. With a reasonable naming convention of course. 

### Prerequisites
For this to achieve you must have a DHCP and DNS server with DDNS configured and running.

### Configuration
Edit `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` on your DHCP server.
```bash
ddns-updates on;
ddns-update-style interim;

key ddns-update.key {
   algorithm HMAC-SHA256;
   secret "52b66d1e81efce864c1a1a3c5435f9e44d0a0b76dd3fd1bb307f818284379264";
};

zone local.lan {
  primary 10.12.0.2; # DNS-Server
 key "ddns-update.key";
}
zone 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa {
   primary 10.12.0.2;
   key "ddns-update.key";
}

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
   range 192.168.0.55 192.168.19.75;
   option routers 192.168.0.1;
   option domain-search  "local.lan";
   ddns-domainname  "local.lan";
}
```
{: file="/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf"}

Similar to the DDNS configuration file you have to place the exact same `key` and `forward / reverse zone` definitions above your subnet definitions. When your finished it's time to restart the DHCP service.
> In `key` definition the name of the key could be another than in DDNS config but the `secret` must be the same.
{: .prompt-warning }

### Troubleshooting
Type `journalctl -u` to show the last 30 entries with `-n30`.
```bash
journalctl -u isc-dhcp-server -f -n30
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| -u | Systemd unit, like `isc-dhcp-server` |
| -f | Following, new offers will displayed immediatly |
| -n*X* | Also display the last *X* entries |

The Output should look like this:
```terminal
