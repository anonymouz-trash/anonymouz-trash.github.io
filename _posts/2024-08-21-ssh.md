Here you will find an SSH configuring and hardening guide.

## Installation
```bash
apt install openssh-server openssh-client
```

## Usage
Server:
```bash
systemctl enable sshd.service
systemctl ( start | stop | restart ) sshd.service
```
Client:
```bash
ssh [options] user@host [command]
```

## Common options

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
|-p|port number, if you changed the standard port|
|-i|alternative identify file, like ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub|
|-j|ProxyJump-Host, like user@host, if you want to connect to an otherwise unreachable host|
|-Y|X11-Forwarding of graphical apps through ssh|

## Generating ssh keys
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pq
```
This private/public key pair will be created in your home folder, `~/.ssh`. You will also be asked if you want to set a password for your key pair. This is used for every "new" use of this key pair to decrypt it. This key is post-quantum save.

## Copy id to ssh-client for authentication
The following command will copy all generated public keys to a host you want to authenticate without password.
```bash
ssh-copy-id user@host
```

It is also possible to define options like if you need to make use of ProxyJump-host or define a specific id.
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub -o "ProxyJump <host or ip>" user@host
```

## Server configuration (Example)
Usually you'll find the configuration file in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Keep an eye on `sshd` not `ssh`.
```bash
# OpenSSH sshd_config
# Profile: ECC-only identities + Post-Quantum hybrid KEX
# Requires: OpenSSH >= 9.0 (tested with 10.0p1)

# Network
Port 22
AddressFamily inet
ListenAddress 192.168.0.4

# Host Keys (ECC only)
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519

# Key Exchange (Post-Quantum Hybrid ONLY)
KexAlgorithms sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com

# Symmetric Crypto (AEAD only)
Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com

# MACs not used with AEAD ciphers

# Authentication
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
UsePAM no
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# User keys: ECC only
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-ed25519

# Authorization scope
# AllowUsers <DEIN_USER>

# Session hardening
LoginGraceTime 30s
MaxAuthTries 2
MaxSessions 3

ClientAliveInterval 300
ClientAliveCountMax 1

# Channel restrictions
AllowAgentForwarding no
AllowTcpForwarding no
GatewayPorts no
X11Forwarding no
PermitTunnel no

# Environment
PermitUserEnvironment no
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*

# Logging
SyslogFacility AUTH
LogLevel VERBOSE

# Misc
TCPKeepAlive yes
PrintMotd no
Banner none
VersionAddendum none

# Subsystems
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
```
{: file="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"}

| value | description |
| --- | --- |
| Port < xx > | Specifies another port to be used by SSH. Default: 22 |
| AddressFamily | Setting: any / inet / inet6, inet=IPv4, inet6=IPv6 |
| ListenAddress | Specifies the IP of the interface SSH should only listen on. |
| PubKeyAuthentication | yes/no, Turn on/off authentication with key pairs. |
| AuthorizedKeyFile | Location of authorized key collection file |
| PermitRootLogin | yes/no, prohibit-password means password authentication is disabled but authentication with key pair is till possible |
| X11Forwarding | yes/no, if you want to access graphical applications through ssh |
| AllowTcpForwarding | Allow "ProxyJump"-ing on this host |

## Client configuration (Example)
Therefore you have to create a file called `~/.ssh/config` in your home directory.
```bash
Host ssh-proxy
        User root
        Hostname 172.16.0.2
        Port 2222
Host dhcp-server
        User root
        Hostname 10.11.12.2
        Port 2222
        ProxyJump ssh-proxy
```
{: file="~/.ssh/config"}

| value | description |
| --- | --- |
| Host < hostname > | This keyword defines defines the "short word" to connect to your clients. |
| User < username > | The user you want to connect with on the host. |
| Hostname < IP > | Specifies th IP address you want to connect to. |
| Port < Port > | Specifies the port you want to connect to in case you've changed it. |
| ProxyJump < IP or Host > | If you have to connect to a host which is not directly accessible, but with a "jump" from another host. |

```bash
ssh dhcp-server
```
You're also able to modify the command, e.g. you want to connect on the wanted machine with another user.
```bash
ssh user@dhcp-server
```
## Secure Copy (SCP)
Secure-Copy allows file duplication over SSH.

### Usage
```bash
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub -J firewall -P 222 source_file user@server:/path/to/destination
```
> As you see the same options as in ssh are available.
{: .prompt-info }

## Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
Secure File Transfer Protocol comes with the `openssh-server`, and for other os similar, package. It is deactivated by default and had to be configured.

### Configuration
Now we add a SFTP user which is only allowed to use SFTP and nothing else. Therefor create a new group called `sftponly`
```bash
groupadd sftponly
```
```bash
mkdir -pv /srv/sftp/users/guest
useradd -G sftponly -d /srv/sftp/users/guest -s /bin/false guest
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| -G | Append a group to the standard groups. |
| -d | The home dir of the user. |
| -s | The given Shell, here it is nothing |

At first we have to create a user share with permissions as below.
```bash
mkdir -pv /srv/sftp/share
chown root:root /srv/sftp/share
chmod 0755 /srv/sftp/share
```

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` scroll down to `Subsystem sftp [...]`.
```bash
Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
UsePAM yes
Match Group sftponly
        ChrootDirectory /srv/sftp/path/to/share/%u
        ForceCommand internal-sftp
        AllowTcpForwarding no
        PasswordAuthentication yes
```
{: file="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"}

### Usage
```bash
sftp guest@sftp-server
```
