This is an absolute fantastic way to setup alternative launchers directly in Steam! I used [NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck](https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck)-Repository by `moraroy` to accomplish that. The name implies that this might be Steam Deck only but its also Arch Linux and gave it a try. To give you a spoiler: `"It works flawlessly"`

## Installation
* Prerequisites
To work with GitHub repositories it is essential that you have `git` and `base-devel` installed:

```shell
pacman -S git base-devel
```
* Clone the repo and `cd` into it

```shell
git clone https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck.git
cd NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck
```

Start the installation by executing the provided script. In the GitHub repository there is also an option to just download a `.desktop` file and launch it that way, but by executing the script in a terminal you'll see what the script is doing and the overall installation process takes time. At some point the GUI also looks like it crashed but it isn't the case.
```shell
chmod +x ./NonSteamLaunchers.sh # Optional if not already executable
./NonSteamLaunchers.sh
```
When the main window appears just tick the launchers you want to install and hit `OK`.

I encourage you to install `proton-ge-custom-bin` package via [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/proton-ge-custom-bin) because it provides always the latest Proton build by `GloriousEggroll`.

## Add mount points in NonSteam games
For me I download every game from Steam and alternative launchers to a external drive. I found out that there is no easy way to add mount points to a NonSteam game via `winecfg`. Especially when `protontricks` do not find the AppID to a NonSteam game. So I decided to write a little script for that problem. Source: [https://github.com/anonymouz-trash/Steam-Proton-Manager](https://github.com/anonymouz-trash/Steam-Proton-Manager)

### Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/anonymouz-trash/Steam-Proton-Manager.git
cd Steam-Proton-Manager
```
```shell
sudo ln steam-proton-manager.sh /usr/local/bin/steam-proton-manager
```
> You can `hard link` the script to `/usr/local/bin` to make it globally available. ;-) In case of updates to the repository the hard linked file will be the exact same as the source. So don't have to do this step every time.
{: .prompt-tip }

### Usage
```shell
USAGE: $0 {"STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH"} {"shortcut"}

Example: $0 /home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/<appid> winecfg

Hint: Always use absolute paths! The 2nd parameter is optional.

The 2nd paramater can be used as shortcut:
control  = start Control Panel
regedit  = start Regisitry Editor
taskmgr  = start Task Manager
winecfg  = start WINE-Configuration
tricks   = start winetricks
fonts    = Install core (f)onts
vcrun    = Install Visual (C)++ Runtime 2015-2022
dotnet   = Install .(N)ET 4.8
```

* 1st: Check the AppID in your local "../steamapps/compatdata/" folder

```shell
ls -l ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata 

insgesamt 24
drwxr-xr-x 3 tommy tommy 4096 30. Nov 11:57 0
drwxr-xr-x 3 tommy tommy 4096  1. Mai 10:41 2348590
drwxr-xr-x 3 tommy tommy 4096  1. Mai 08:58 2805730
drwxr-xr-x 3 tommy tommy 4096  1. Mai 08:06 3658110
drwxr-xr-x 4 tommy tommy 4096 29. Mai 07:36 4206469918
lrwxrwxrwx 1 tommy tommy   62 29. Mai 07:38 NonSteamLaunchers -> /home/tommy/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/4206469918
```

There you'll a file called `NonSteamLaunchers`. This file is linked to the right folder with digits. That is our wanted folder. Copy the absolute path `/home/tommy/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/4206469918`.

* 2nd: Start my script as shown below

```shell
steam-proton-manager /home/tommy/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/4206469918 winecfg
```

This will start the `Wine Configuration` window where you are able to add mount points via the `Drives` panel.

### The easier way

Just add a symbolic link to the directory you want to mount as a windows drive.

```shell
ln -s /path/to/mount/directory /path/to/prefix/dosdevices/d: 
```
