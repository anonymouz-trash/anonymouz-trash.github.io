Squid is a caching proxy for HTTP, HTTPS and FTP, providing extensive access controls. 

## Concepts
There are different types of how you can configure your proxy server.

### Standard
![squid_standard](/assets/img/squid_standard.drawio.svg)
* configured in browser
* or gets deployed as `proxy.pac`
* configured by DHCP
*  configured by Active Directory group policies

### Transparent
![squid_transparent](/assets/img/squid_transparent.drawio.svg)
* Port 80 & 443 getting redirected to the proxy server by the firewall
* Proxy has to be in `Splice` or `Intercept` mode
* HTTPS scanning only works if the SSL certificate gets broken open by the proxy

### URL Scan (splice mode)
* Proxy just sees the URL in the HTTPS traffic
* Sites can be blocked by the URL
* No virus scanning

### Content Scan (intercepting mode)
* The client must have the proxy's CA certificate in its certificate store
* The client "thinks" it's communicating with the original web server
* Virus scanning is possible, also filtering by IDS / IPS systems
* It is a "Man-In-The-Middle-Attack" in fact.

## Installation
For transparent mode install:
```bash
apt install squid
```

For intercepting mode you need:
```bash
apt install squid-openssl
```

## Configuration
Make a copy of the original provided `squid.conf` in `/etc/squid`.
```bash
cd /etc/squid
cp /etc/squid.conf{,.orig}
```

Just grab all lines that are not comments and put it `squid.conf`.
```bash
grep "^[^#]" squid.conf.orig > squid.conf
```
```bash
...

# If squid crashes a dump is written there

# Caching behaviour
refresh_pattern ^ftp:           1440    20%     10080
refresh_pattern ^gopher:        1440    0%      1440
refresh_pattern -i (/cgi-bin/|\?) 0     0%      0
refresh_pattern (Release|Packages(.gz)*)$      0       20%     2880
refresh_pattern .               0       20%     4320

# Syntax: refresh_pattern [-i] regex min percent max [options]
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

| value | description |
| --- | --- |
| regex | means regular expression for that kind of requestes this rule matches |
| -i | regex by default is case-sensitive, not with -i |
| min | time in minutes in were objects are considerd "fresh" |
| percent | percent of objects are considered "fresh" |
| max | max-time in minutes were objects are considered "fresh" |

## Usage
> If you had just edited the configuration it's always better to `reload` squid instead of `restarting` it because it would take a huge amount of time to do that. Usually around 10 min.
{: .prompt-warning }
```bash
systemctl reload squid.service
```
```bash
systemctl ( start | stop | restart ) squid.service
```

## Troubleshooting
```bash
systemctl status squid.service
```
or to see squid in action:
```bash
tail -fn0 /var/log/squid/access.log
```
> You'll not see any user or passwords there. Just URLs and IPs.

## Redirect traffic to squid with nftables
```bash
table ip nat {

    chain prerouting {

        type nat hook prerouting priority 0; policy accept;

        # redirect HTTP to locally installed Squid instance
        tcp dport 80 redirect to :3126

        # redirect HTTPS to locally installed Squid instance
        tcp dport 443 redirect to :3127
    }

    # enable nat for all packets going to the intenet through wan
    chain postrouting {
        type nat hook postrouting priority 100; policy accept;
        oifname $wan_if masquerade
    }
}
```
{: file="/etc/nftables.conf"}

## Access Control List Basics
ACLs, as they should, are checked in top to bottom order. So be careful where you place your rules.

### Give access to `LAN` and `DMZ` network
This all happens in `/etc/squid/squid.conf`.

Build ACLs:
```bash
acl lan src 172.16.150.0/24
acl dmz src  10.40.115.0/24
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

Use ACLs:
```bash
http_access allow lan
http_access allow dmz
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

### Restrict access to specific websites
```bash
acl facebook url_regex -i facebook
http_access deny facebook
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

You can also build blacklists or whitelists. Create a file called `bad-sites.list`.
```bash
facebook
telegram
whatsapp
```
{: file="/etc/squid/bad-sites.list"}

Now build and use the ACL:
```bash
acl bad-sites  url_regex -i "/etc/squid/bad-sites.list"
http_access deny bad-sites
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

## Authentication
This is used and common in enterprise environments to control the access to the internet for specific kind of coworkers and/or restrict their access rights.

### Installation
To accomplish that we need to install an additional package providing us `htpasswd`.
```bash
apt install apache2-utils
```

### Add user (local authentication)
We have to create a password file (db) for all of our local users, for example `/etc/squid/password_db`.
```bash
htpasswd -B -c /etc/squid/password_db user
```
> Be aware all passwords in this file are stored as hashes and `MD5` is set to default which is very insecure.
{: .prompt-warning }

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| -m | Force MD5 hashing of the password (default) |
| -2 | Force SHA-256 hashing of the password (secure) |
| -5 | Force SHA-512 hashing of the password (secure) |
| -B | Force bcrypt hashing of the password (very secure) |
| -C | Set the computing time used for the bcrypt algorithm (default: 5, valid: 4 to 17) |
| -r | Set the number of rounds used for the SHA-256, SHA-512 algorithms (default: 5000) |
| -d | Force CRYPT hashing of the password (8 chars max, insecure) |
| -s | Force SHA-1 hashing of the password (insecure) |
| -p | Do not hash the password (plaintext, insecure) |
| -D | Delete the specified user |
| -v | Verify password for the specified user |
 
### Configuration
Edit `/etc/squid/squid.conf`.
```bash
auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/password_db
auth_param basic children 20 startup=0 idle=1
auth_param basic concurrency 0
auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours
auth_param basic realm user-access-password_db
auth_param basic casesensitive off
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

Add an ACL:
```bash
acl user-access-password_db proxy_auth REQUIRED
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

Add an access rule:
```bash
http_access allow user-access-password_db
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

### User authentication against LDAP
Edit `/etc/squid/squid.conf`.
```bash
auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid3/basic_ldap_auth -b "dc=local,dc=lan" -f "uid=%s" -h 10.12.0.2
auth_param basic children 50
auth_param basic realm user_access_ldap
auth_param basic credentialsttl 1 minute
auth_param basic casesensitive off
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

Add an ACL:
```bash
acl user_access_ldap proxy_auth REQUIRED
acl SSL_ports port 443
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

Add an access rule:
```bash
http_access allow user_access_ldap
```
{: file="/etc/squid/squid.conf"}

### Testing with LDAP
```bash
echo username ’password' | /usr/lib/squid3/basic_ldap_auth -b "dc=local,dc=lan" -f "uid=%s" -h 10.12.0.2
```
> Password must be in single quotes `'` because of using special characters. echo with double quotes `"` will operate differnet that way.
