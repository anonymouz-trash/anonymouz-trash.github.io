## Definition
The fstab file can be used to define how disk partitions or remote file systems should be mounted into the file system.
The file you have to edit is `/etc/fstab` and would look like this:
```bash
# Static information about the filesystems.
# See fstab(5) for details.

# <file system> <dir> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
# /dev/sda2
UUID=232c16da-6f07-4f54-9bc1-494f97c05c5e       /               ext4            rw,relatime     0 1

# /dev/sda1
UUID=219E-A7C7          /boot           vfat            rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro       0 2
```
{: file="/etc/fstab"}

| option | description |
| --- | --- |
| < file system > | describes the block special device or remote file system to be mounted, you can use `sudo blkid`. You can use UUIDs, PARTUUIDs, direct access like /dev/sd*X* and so on  |
| < dir > | describes the mount directory |
| < type > | the file system type, like auto, ext4, btrfs, ntfs-3g ... |
| < options > | the associated mount options, like defaults, rw, relatime |
| < dump > | is checked by the dump utility. This field is usually set to 0, which disables the check. |
| < pass > | sets the order for file system checks at boot time. For the root device it should be 1. For other partitions it should be 2, or 0 to disable checking. |


## Mounting additional partitions
I use this often for my Batocera partition to easily access it whenever I want or have to configure any change or to access my shares on my NAS.
> You have to create the corresponding mountpoints **before** mounting the devices or remote locations in it.
{: .prompt-tip }

```bash
# /dev/sdb1 - Batocera boot partition
/dev/disk/by-uuid/2067-EAA3 /run/media/user/batocera-boot-local vfat user,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0022,nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 2

# /dev/sdb2 - Batocera share partition
/dev/disk/by-uuid/5c329796-f5ae-487d-b747-3255c7b1b0a5 /run/media/user/batocera-share-local ext4 defaults,nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 2

#SMB-Share
//192.168.178.5/backups /home/user/NAS/backups cifs user,noauto,_netdev,uid=1000,gid=1000,dir_mode=0770,file_mode=0770,credentials=/home/tommy/.smb,iocharset=utf8,vers=3.0 0 0
```
{: file="/etc/fstab"}

In this example I used the files in `/dev` folder to locate the partitions, but you can also use `UUID=`. 

**Filesystem** options:

| option | description |
| --- | --- |
| /run/media/user | this is the standard mount point used by Arch so I created folders inside to easy remember it, user would be your username of course |
| auto | this is the partition type, could also be `vfat` for the boot partition and `ext4` or `btrfs` for the share partition or `cifs` for samba remote locations |

**Mounting** options:

| option | description |
| --- | --- |
| users | means that non-root users are allowed to mount/unount this partition |
| auto | or `noauto` means if this device or remote location should be mount at boot, for remote locations it is recommended to also set `_netdev` |
| rw | have read/write access |
| uid=1000 | user id of your user to manipulate the user file permissions regardingless of the actual user of the files, get it in terminal with `id` |
| gid=1000 | same with the group id |
| x-gvfs-show | mount point shows up in sidebar of dolphin or nautilus (file managers) |

> `_netdev` mount option ensures the mount point would be loaded **after** the network is initialized. I would also recommend for mobile devices like laptops to  set the `noauto` option especially if the remote location is only available on local networks or through VPNs.

## Mount and unmount
After you're finished any change must be made known to the system.
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo umount -a
sudo mount -a
```

> The 2nd command unmounts all devices known in fstab and the 3rd command mounts them all again. You can also use the exact mountpoint as paremeter instead of -a.
{: .prompt-info }

> Note: If you had Arch Linux kernel updates and didn't reboot you're not able to mount `cifs` partitions.
