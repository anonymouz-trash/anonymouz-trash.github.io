The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a community-driven repository for Arch Linux users. The AUR was created to organize and share new packages from the community and to help expedite popular packages' inclusion into the extra repository.
> Warning: AUR packages are user-produced content. Any use of the provided files is at your own risk.

## Prerequesites
Following dependencies are needed to be installed.
```bash
sudo pacman -S git curl wget build-essential
```

## Installing AUR packages manually
First you need to visit [Arch Linux AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org) and look for a package (application) you want. For instance we will install an AUR helper like `yay`. Therefor open a terminal and change your working directory to `/opt`. This is the common location for installing AUR packages. On the AUR website we are searching for `yay`, click on the package name and copy the GIT url to clipboard.
In Terminal (as root):
```bash
sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
```
After cloning change the permissions to your user and change in the `yay` directory, like:
```bash
sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} yay && cd yay
```
Next to download, compile and package it run:
```bash
makepkg -si
```

| parameter | description |
|---|---|
| -s | Means synchronize dependencies |
| -i | Install after building, compiling and packaging |

If done correctly you now have installed an AUR helper.

## Installing AUR packages with AUR helper
`yay` is called a pacman wrapper. It means you can also use it to install packages from the offial arch repos.
```bash
yay proton
```
Output:
```bash
3 extra/protonmail-bridge-core 3.12.0-3 (7.9 MiB 25.4 MiB) 
    Integrate ProtonMail paid account with any program that supports IMAP and SMTP (core executable and daemon)
2 extra/protonmail-bridge 3.12.0-3 (1.5 MiB 3.1 MiB) 
    Integrate ProtonMail paid account with any program that supports IMAP and SMTP (Qt desktop application)
1 aur/proton 1:9.0.2.4-1 (+110 2.38) 
    Compatibility tool for Steam Play based on Wine and additional components
==> Zu installierende Pakete: (z.B. 1 2 3, 1-3 oder ^4)
==> 
```
`yay` is shown the best suited answer with the corresponding number in front. You can install the applications by just hit `1` and enter or type `1-3` for all applications or `1 3` for the first and the third application.
You can also do:
```bash
yay -S proton-ge-custom
yay -R proton-ge-custom
yay -Rsnc proton-ge-custom
```

| parameter | description |
|---|---|
| -S | Installs programs |
| -R | Removes programs, but leave any configuration dirs |
| -Rsnc | Remove programs including configuration dirs and dependencies |

## Troubleshooting
If some AUR package doesn't install because of an error in `PKGBUILD` you can have a look at this in `~/.cache/yay/packagename`.
For example, I like the windows app `mp3tag`. Sadly there's no similar good program in Linux. The AUR git for this program is designed to ever download the latest setup.exe and installing it into a wine prefix. Nevertheless it also compares the downloaded file with a SHA256 checksum which do not match if the download setup version is newer than the `PKGBUILD` script.
So I open a terminal and the corresponding `PKGBUILD`, e.g. in `~/.cache/yay/mp3tag/PKGBUILD`. It looks somewhat like this.
```bash
...
pkgname=mp3tag
pkgver=3.26
pkgrel=1
pkgdesc="The universal tag editor"
arch=(i686 x86_64)
url="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/"
license=(custom)
depends=(wine)
makedepends=(p7zip)
source=(mp3tag
        LICENSE
        mp3tag.desktop
        mp3tag.png)
source_i686=("https://download.mp3tag.de/${pkgname}v${pkgver/./}setup.exe")
source_x86_64=("https://download.mp3tag.de/${pkgname}v${pkgver/./}-x64-setup.exe")
sha256sums=('378eabc03c7a4c6aa56c5aa90141204a04b727f7dc60e66a7f36a87a7eeae7d8'
            '18967b634e69d8ccb08383d42a49ced3c0b11c632649a15c3a6a55e3a27f62e9'
            'bc0c7b8a7a9f9ee92dfe2f1880ef5d91920473713b5d60e4afa361d69a446798'
            'a3e09f7cda34bc31b3b5b1d7cf2010c3b17847c141ef5a074472eb72f760f6bf')
sha256sums_i686=('ae1ba0d8b3f73c53a0f12886590e2d6d6159769c1bc99579c3c3cc0e46f07972')
sha256sums_x86_64=('02a277625061d2999a9af143d84b8d76387cf5683d11baeb599bc4a5df0e615e')
....
```
{: file="~/.cache/yay/mp3tag/PKGBUILD"}

The newest version, as of writing this, is version `3.27a` so I go to there official website and download the latest setup.exe. After that I must generate a new SHA256 checksum of that file and replace it with the architecture checksum of my system.
```bash
sha256sum mp3tagv327a-x64-setup.exe
```

Output is:
```bash
4fcf96d0fb2fb3ac649803ecf927d260437e05e5f762a98ec5c01770b351fe1f  mp3tagv327a-x64-setup.exe
```

After replacing the new checksum with the old one **save** `PKGBUILD` file run this inside the same directory:
```bash
makepkg -si
```
> This is only an example when things go wrong and to be clear this happens very very seldom.
